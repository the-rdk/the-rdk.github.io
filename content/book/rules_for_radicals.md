## Selected Quotes

* I gave the young radicals seemed to me the only realistic one: "Do one of three things. One, go find a wailing wall 
  and feel sorry for yourselves. Two, go psycho and start bombing—but this will only swing people to the right. 
  Three, learn a lesson. Go home, organize, build power and at the next convention, you be the delegates.
  
* A word about my personal philosophy. It is anchored in optimism. It must be, for optimism brings with it hope, a 
  future with a purpose, and therefore, a will to fight for a better world. Without this optimism, there is no reason 
  to carry on.

* The means-and-end moralists or non-doers always wind up on their ends without any means.

* Machiavelli's blindness to the necessity for moral clothing to all acts and motives—he said "politics has no relation 
  to morals"—was his major weakness.
  
* Democracy is not an end; it is the best political means available toward the achievement of these values.

* The real action is in the enemy's reaction.
  The enemy properly goaded and guided in his reaction will he your major strength.
  Tactics, like organization, like life, require that you move with the action.
