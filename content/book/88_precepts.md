88 Precepts is a short collection of Neo-Nazi philosophical maxims and is best known for introducing the infamous 1488 slogan.

> We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.

14 Words, 88 Precepts, HH. With its core ideals thoroughly embedded within the far-right, its target demographic will already be familiar with its best ideas. Your time on 4chan will have already filled you in on the best it has to offer. What is left still has some punch but suffers from familiarity and the occasional sophistry.

> One measure of a man is cheerfulness in adversity.

> Materialism leads men to seek artificial status through wealth or property. True social status comes from service to Family, Race and Nation.

Published in the early 1990s, 88 Precepts pre-dates the mainstream adoption of the internet. The author was David Lane, a former member of The John Birch Society, The Ku Klux Klan, The Aryan Nations and, most famously, The Order. Lane is documented as having stolen $4.1 million in car hijackings, organised military training and killed three people. He passed away in prison in 2007.

> Truth does not fear investigation.

> The concept of “equality” is declared a lie by every evidence of Nature. It is a search for the lowest common denominator, and its pursuit will destroy every superior race, nation, or culture. In order for a plow horse to run as fast as a race horse you would first have to cripple the race horse; conversely, in order for a race horse to pull as much as a plow horse, you would first have to cripple the plow horse. In either case, the pursuit of equality is the destruction of excellence.

Despite suffering from how common its core ideas have become, 88 Precepts still has value to offer beyond its infamous 14 words. As a short read, it will have the most value to the more fresh-faced fellow traveller than the seasoned frog.
