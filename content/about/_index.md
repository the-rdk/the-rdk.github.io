The RDK is a European Book Club aiming to encourage and support members in the pursuit of research, skill development 
and writing proficiency.

The Book Club provides an opportunity to expose members to new ideas while developing their own literary skills by 
writing book reports. The book choice is decided by voting. Although there is no set genre the choices tend to 
lean towards politics and philosophy.

We are open to new members who would like to take a more active role in producing their own writing and sharing their
thoughts in contrast to the passive position typical of netflix mass-society.
