The RDK is a Right-Wing European Book Club aiming to encourage and support members in the pursuit of research, skill 
development and writing proficiency.

The Book Club provides an opportunity to expose members to new ideas and also to stretch their literary skills by 
writing reports. Books are chosen by vote. There is no set genre, although the books tend to lean towards politics and
philosophy.

We are open to new members who would like to take a more active role in setting their own goals, producing their own 
writing and sharing their thoughts with other like-minded people.
