The RDK is a European book club looking to bring aspirational men together. The club is a place for members to discuss 
current events, books and their personal projects with like-minded people.

The club has an emphasis on written work, however members also pursue projects across a variety of domains from art to 
engineering. We hope this environment encourages members to produce interesting work and create opportunities
for collaboration.

We are open to new members keen on exploring their interests and developing their literary skills alongside frens. See
[here](/book) for how to join.
