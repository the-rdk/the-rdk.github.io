<title>Strength Through Play: Why you should join a Club - The RDK</title>

<p>In 19th century London, a young man looking to establish himself in the capital could rely on the comfort of their Club housing until they could afford rent independently. Beyond a home away from home, these Gentleman&rsquo;s Clubs were a place of friendship, sport and entertainment. Historians have since <a href="https://vdoc.pub/documents/the-hellfire-clubs-sex-satanism-and-secret-societies-7ak9sienork0">described</a> these clubs as a &ldquo;part of the power nexus of capitalism, and essential to the continuity of elite dominance of society.&rdquo; That is, they were a good place where our lot could kick back, have fun and plan trouble.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s Clubs would similarly grow in popularity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Like the men&rsquo;s, these clubs were not political but focused on hobbies or topics of interest. Despite this seemingly apolitical nature, they provided women with a means through which to organise and would go on to wield significant <a href="https://the-rdk.github.io/book/propaganda/">societal influence</a>. The Women&rsquo;s Rights movement saw its origins in these groups. This same movement would then disassemble the men&rsquo;s clubs in their efforts to deconstruct gender norms.</p>
<p>Young men today do not have their own space and do not organise. We do not have the old clubs and have lost our societal position to affirmative action. Support and guidance are hard to come by as many <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/david-cameron-we-were-all-white-men-so-i-did-something-about-diversity-xlnnq7szm">older men</a> self-servingly sacrifice the young to the church of diversity. From the loss of a space of our own, we have not just lost out on friendships; we have lost our political representation.</p>
<p>The Dissident Right has built a decentralised movement through fun and humour. Still, its presence remains disorganised and confined to niche parts of the online world. The need for anonymity and the isolation of the faceless crowd are a sterile environment for a Frog looking to make friends. A new programme must fill this void, an association of clubs gathering men for shenanigans and taboo humour!</p>
<p>These clubs must be non-political and decentralised. Our enemies are organised and watching, but this is not the setback you may think it is. Groups of men joined by friendship are an inherently political force, even if not explicitly organised as one. It is more important that these clubs be fun, the humour daring and that our reader steps out of his comfort zone to join one.</p>
<p>The RDK is one such group, a book club. Perhaps you might join? If you are not a great reader, we will make you one. If you are not a great writer, we&rsquo;ll get you some practice. Other clubs are also forming, some online and others offline - perhaps basket weaving is more to your taste? The criteria for a good group are simple: it must have a non-political focus you enjoy, and it must exclude women. You&rsquo;ll want to face the impending Rhodesia alongside good friends.</p>
<p>The world needs great trouble makers, and trouble makers do not come out of thin air. As the generations before us knew, they are made from pacts of brotherhood. Too many young men lose their souls to video games and pornography. Lifting the traditional gentleman&rsquo;s club into a modern format will give them a space of ownership and growth. There is opportunity in the decline for men willing to take to the waves against this lethargic bureaucracy. However, they must be united and daring to do so.</p>
