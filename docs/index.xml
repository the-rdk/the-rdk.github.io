Rules for Radicals is a window into the famous Jewish revolutionary spirit. A great read. It touches on morals, mindset and tactics. Both Nietzsche and Machiavelli make unexpected appearances. A recommended read to dissidents of any persuasion.
Selected Passages Rules to the Ethics of Means and Ends  One&amp;rsquo;s concern with the ethics of means and ends varies inversely with one&amp;rsquo;s personal interest in the issue. One&amp;rsquo;s concern with the ethics of means and ends varies inversely with one&amp;rsquo;s distance from the scene of conflict.</description>

      <title>Bronze Age Mindset by Bronze Age Pervert</title>

Don&amp;rsquo;t let the authors poor grammar fool you, Bronze Age Mindset punches above its weight and is worth reading through more than once. His style of writing is energetically humorous, and at times absurd. Highly recommended.
Bronze Age Pervert (BAP) builds heavily upon Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s body of work, though he has several other notable influences. Namely: Paglia, Schopenhauer, Machiavelli, and Mishima.
Cautionary note: Chimpanzees do in fact jerk off in nature.</description>

The book makes many unsourced claims, and when it does provide sources they are frequently unreliable.
However, reading and verifying the claims in the book drew attention to a number of interesting events and ideas:
 The Chicago Plan: A proposal for &amp;ldquo;full-reserve&amp;rdquo; banking.
 The author is of the opinion that the Great Depression was intentionally caused by the Federal Reserve. Economist Milton Friedman held a similar opinion, that they failed to perform their duty as a lender of last resort.</description>

Selected Quotes Chapter 4, Pg 36 Success comes when both the timing and placing of the blow are just right. But more than this, it happens when the choice of time and target—one’s judgement—manages to catch the foe momentarily off guard, when one has an intuitive apprehension of that off-guard moment a fraction of a second before it becomes perceptible to the senses.</description>
