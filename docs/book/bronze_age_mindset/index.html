<p>Don&rsquo;t let the authors poor grammar fool you, Bronze Age Mindset punches above its weight and is worth reading through
more than once. His style of writing is energetically humorous, and at times absurd. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Bronze Age Pervert (BAP) builds heavily upon Nietzsche&rsquo;s body of work, though he has several other notable influences.
Namely: Paglia, Schopenhauer, Machiavelli, and Mishima.</p>

<p><strong>Cautionary note</strong>: Chimpanzees do in fact jerk off in nature.</p>

<p>Milius is a self-proclaimed &ldquo;Zen anarchist&rdquo;, but he also publicly aligns himself with conservative factions in Hollywood and he was interviewed in the documentary Rated R: Republicans in Hollywood. He has also been consultant to a military think tank, the Institute for Creative Technologies. Milius said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a reactionary—I&rsquo;m just a right-wing extremist so far beyond the Christian Identity people like that and stuff, that they can&rsquo;t even imagine. I&rsquo;m so far beyond that I&rsquo;m a Maoist. I&rsquo;m an anarchist. I&rsquo;ve always been an anarchist. Any true, real right-winger if he goes far enough hates all form of government, because government should be done to cattle and not human beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Described by Elizabeth Danto as a large man with a cantankerous style who managed to look scruffy and elegant at the same time, he tried to reconcile psychoanalysis with Marxism, arguing that neurosis is rooted in sexual and socio-economic conditions, and in particular in a lack of what he called &ldquo;orgastic potency&rdquo;.
He visited patients in their homes to see how they lived, and took to the streets in a mobile clinic, promoting adolescent sexuality and the availability of contraceptives, abortion and divorce, a provocative message in Catholic Austria.</p>

<p>Freeman argued that Mead had misunderstood Samoan culture when she argued that Samoan culture did not place many restrictions on youths&rsquo; sexual explorations.
While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having wilfully misled Mead. She said that she and her friends were having fun with Mead and telling her stories.
It&rsquo;s still disputed whether her research is valid or not.</p>

<p>Wandervogel is the name adopted by a popular movement of German youth groups from 1896 to 1933, who protested against industrialization by going to hike in the country and commune with nature in the woods. Drawing influence from medieval wandering scholars, their ethos was to revive old Teutonic values, with a strong emphasis on German nationalism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But despite his love of psychopathy and his accelerationism and militaristic/militant leanings, he does occasionally make good common sense, for example his observation that pure democracy is suicidal and a guarantee of disaster, especially if the population is &lsquo;diverse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="page-82-paragraph-1">Page 82, Paragraph 1</h3>

<p>The true environmentalism is racism and has a racial foundation, and in fact the two things, environmentalism and racism, are indistinguishable.</p>

<h3 id="page-88">Page 88</h3>

<p>Saddam Hussein was like this: he was a transsexual in his soul.</p>

<h3 id="page-130">Page 130</h3>

<p>Among your instincts you will find the longing for strong friendships, that the modern evil tries to snuff out. And they have good reason to try this, because every great thing in the past was done through strong friendships between two men, or brotherhoods of men, and this includes all great political things, all acts of political freedom and power.</p>

<h3 id="page-192">Page 192</h3>

<p>The left realizes they look weak and lame—because they are. They know they have nothing to offer youth but submission and lectures. They know they&rsquo;re unsexy and staid. If indeed young leftist men will start lifting and worshiping beauty, they will be forced to leave the left.</p>
