<p>The book makes many unsourced claims, and when it does provide sources they are frequently unreliable.</p>

<p>However, reading and verifying the claims in the book drew attention to a number of interesting events and ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_plan#A_Program_for_Monetary_Reform">The Chicago Plan</a>: A proposal for
&ldquo;full-reserve&rdquo; banking.</p></li>

<li><p>The author is of the opinion that the Great Depression was intentionally caused by the Federal Reserve. Economist
Milton Friedman held a similar opinion,
<a href="https://fee.org/articles/the-great-depression-according-to-milton-friedman/">that they failed to perform their duty as a lender of last resort</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The Bank of England had the now dormant Bank of England Nominees which was exempt from the requirement
to declare the identities of their shareholders. The Guardian claims the Queen made use of it to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/feb/07/revealed-queen-lobbied-for-change-in-law-to-hide-her-private-wealth">hide her private wealth</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Gottfried Feder, the economist who attracted Hitler into the Nazi party, was an advocate for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Feder">Garden Cities</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The book has an interesting quote attributed to former Governor of The Bank of England Montagu Normal on &ldquo;Capital
must protect itself&rdquo;. It is mentioned even on <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/05/corr-m15.html">The World Socialist Web Site</a>.
As far as I can tell it is <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:J._P._Morgan">fabricated</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>The book makes the unsourced claim that Trotsky was financed by America and Britain. I would very much like to know
if there is a reliable source for that.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bejamin-franklin-pg-60">Bejamin Franklin (Pg 60)</h3>

<p>This is simple. In the colonies we issue our own money. It is called colonial script. We issue it in proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating for ourselves our own money, we control its purchasing power, and we have no interest to pay anyone.</p>

<h3 id="james-abram-garfield-pg-71">James Abram Garfield (Pg 71)</h3>

<p>Whosoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce&hellip; And when you realise that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.</p>
