The Fourth Political Thoery - Fascism with a few extra steps The author attempts to build a foundation to a fourth political theory against Liberalism but mostly rambles in his attempts to do so. However, in these attempts, he provides an engaging analysis and criticism of Liberalism, Communism and Fascism. It is in this analysis that the book shines.

<p>The author attempts to build a foundation to a fourth political theory against Liberalism but mostly rambles in his attempts to do so. However, in these attempts, he provides an engaging analysis and criticism of Liberalism, Communism and Fascism. It is in this analysis that the book shines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a second type of conservatism, which we have called status-quo or liberal conservatism. It is liberal because it says ‘yes’ to the main trend that is realised in modernity. But at each stage of this trend, it attempts to step on the brakes: ‘Let’s go slower, let’s not do that now, let’s postpone that.’&rdquo;</p>
<p>Published in 2012 the author was ahead of his time in some ways. As seen above, Sasha provides an early look into what we now know as the &ldquo;cuck-servative&rdquo;. He similarly mocks Communism for having become an alternate reality game popular with the young bourgeoise.</p>
<p>When critiquing fascism Sasha makes a fatal mistake. He attempts to separate the Racism inherent to Fascism, without proper regard for its inclusion. In short, his analysis completely overlooks Racism being hilarious.</p>
<p>From what can be deciphered Dugin proposes an amalgamation of the strengths of communism and fascism. The result is an &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; endorsement for segregation, an embrace of collective identity and an appeal to the value of tradition. Also known as fascism with a few extra steps and a spot of paint.</p>
<p>Although the book fails in its intended objective, it remains a recommended read. Though you&rsquo;ll want to skim some of the weaker chapters.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is now safe to institute a political program that was once outlawed by modernity. It no longer appears as foolish and doomed for failure as before, because everything in postmodernity looks foolish and doomed for failure, including its most ‘glamorous’ aspects. It is not by chance that the heroes of postmodernity are ‘freaks’ and ‘monsters’ ,’transvestites’ and ‘degenerates’ — this is the law of style. Against the backdrop of the world’s clowns, nothing and no one could look ‘too archaic’, not even the people of Tradition who ignore the imperatives of modern life.</li>
<li>The ideology of progress represents the moral genocide of past generations — in other words, real racism.</li>
<li>However, its own attempts to understand itself lead to failure. The first and the most prominent contradiction is Marx’s unfulfilled prediction about the type of societies that are the most prone to socialist revolutions. He was confident that this would take place in the greatly industrialised countries of Western Europe, which had a high level of manufacturing and contained a large proportion of urban proletariat. Such revolutions were considered impossible in agrarian countries, as well as those countries with an ‘Asiatic’ mode of production, due to their supposed backwardness. In the Twentieth century, everything occurred exactly to the contrary. Socialist revolutions and socialist societies developed in agrarian countries which had a traditional, rural population, while nothing similar occurred in any of the highly developed nations of Europe and America.</li>
<li>What is the postmodern gender? It is a maximisation of ‘the liberal man’, the archetype of which applies to all of its antitheses: the stupid, the poor, the non-White, the little, and so forth. It is also the gender of globalisation, when the properties of a certain type are extended as social standards onto all other types as universalism. Hence the idea that the proletarians are only the bourgeoisie who have not grown rich yet, Blacks are unmodernised whites, and women are not yet fully liberated men.</li>
<li>One of the theorists of the Conservative Revolution was Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, whose book was recently translated into Russian. Other thinkers who belonged to this tendency were Martin Heidegger, the brothers Ernst and Friedrich Jünger, Carl Schmitt, Oswald Spengler, Werner Sombart, Othmar Spann, Friedrich Hielscher, Ernst Niekisch and a whole constellation of mostly German authors, who are sometimes called ‘the dissidents of National Socialism’, because the majority of them, at some stage, supported National Socialism, but soon found themselves in a state of internal emigration, or even in jail.</li>
