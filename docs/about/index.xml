      <description>&lt;p&gt;The RDK is a European book club looking to bring aspirational men together. The club is a place for members to discuss
current events, books and their personal projects with like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club has an emphasis on written work, however members also pursue projects across a variety of domains from art to
engineering. We hope this environment encourages members to produce interesting work and create opportunities
for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are open to new members keen on exploring their interests and developing their literary skills alongside frens. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://the-rdk.github.io/book&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for how to join.&lt;/p&gt;
